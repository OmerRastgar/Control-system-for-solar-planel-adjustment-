# Control system for solar planel adjustment
The aim of this project is to design a solar panel positioning system.They are usually used where less space is
provided for the solar panels and no more additional panels can be added to increase the output.

We will use a servo mechanism to adjust the current panels to make sure that they are always facing the Sun.
This type of motion can be done in two axes where two motors are used to adjust the East-West direction and
North-South direction. We will just be using one motor to adjust the East-West Direction.
It consists of a wooden structure which adjusts its position based on the current light intensity. Light Dependant
Resistors i.e LDRs are used as sensors for the project that have a high resistance in darkness and the least
resistance in high light intensity.
The project serves as a basic framework for large scale applications in the power generation through solar
energy where such a mechanism could act as a control system to adjust the position of big solar cells for
maximum efficiency.

It is important to note that different Markdown processors may support different methods for centering images, so you may need to experiment with different approaches to find one that works for your specific needs.

markdown vs html
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format text. It was designed to be easy to read and write, and it uses a simple formatting syntax that is based on plain text. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standardized system for displaying and formatting web content. It uses a set of tags and attributes to define the structure and layout of a document, and it is more complex than Markdown.

One of the main differences between Markdown and HTML is the level of complexity. Markdown is much simpler than HTML, and it is easier to learn and use. This makes it a good choice for people who want to format text quickly and easily without having to learn a lot of technical details. HTML, on the other hand, is more powerful and flexible than Markdown, but it is also more complex. It requires a deeper understanding of web technologies and programming concepts to use effectively.

Another difference between Markdown and HTML is the way they are used. Markdown is often used for formatting text within a document or on a website, while HTML is used to define the structure and layout of a web page. Markdown is typically converted into HTML by a Markdown processor, which translates the Markdown syntax into HTML tags and attributes. This allows the formatted text to be displayed correctly on the web.

In summary, Markdown is a simpler and easier-to-use markup language that is mainly used for formatting text, while HTML is a more powerful and flexible markup language that is used to define the structure and layout of a web page.

The primary test showed that the implemetation that we took, was adequate. We were able to get the desired
result, which was to maximize light on the top sureface of the plane. This project was designed to get a better
undersatnding of control systems and to uderstand PID controller. Through out the project there were many
meaning full experience that we gained. One of the major abilities that we gained which is inline with the CLOs
of the course we gained better insite in the feedback control. Which helped us to view day to day objects that
may use similar feedback mechanism. We have a greater apprieceiation for modeling systems, as now we have
detailed knowledge of using different modeling methods to simulate systems.
